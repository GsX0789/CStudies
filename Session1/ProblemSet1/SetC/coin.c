//In this exercise, the user will pass a coin amount, let's say 85c cents, and we need to use
//the greedy algorithm to evaluate how many coins is need to a given amount!
//Example:
//

int main(void)
{


    return 0;
}

void GreedyMachine(int coin_amount)
{
    const int QUARTER_COIN = 25;
    const int DIME_COIN = 10;
    const int NICKEL_COIN = 5;
    const int PENNY_COIN = 1;

    //See whether four while loops is necessary, or if it can be done with one while loop and for if's
    //Or One While loop and one switch statment!
}
